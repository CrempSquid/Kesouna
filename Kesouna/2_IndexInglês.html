	<P>
		Internet security is very important, our data is constantly being manipulated and monitored by third parties all the time.
		When we use the service of an application, browser, web page etc... we often even agree with terms that we don't even read, but there are
		different ways for you to know where you are stepping, having habits to prevent yourself against this type of situation or using tools to your advantage.
		Before starting, I would like to stress the importance of data protection on the internet. It's a very vast environment that can provide many good things and
		bad,
		and to take full advantage of this environment, it is interesting to prevent any type of violation of privacy, data collection... at
		internet if
		if we are careless and ignorant we can fall into scams and traps at first silly, not only, but provide even too much personal data to companies and these
		sell to third parties without your consent many times, not counting the amount of permissions we give these companies to access our devices,
		may use all this information against you in a bad sense.
		Many people think that surfing anonymously on Google, not posting photos on social networks already inhibits them from any kind of violation of their rights
		as an internet user. That's not quite how it works, being careful, reading and looking for more about the circumstance is already an obvious thing to do to
		prevent, however, there are things that are unavoidable but that can be alleviated with some processes partially guaranteeing your privacy and security.
